TASK: Create a detailed intervention plan for a class showing difficulties in emotional recognition and expression.

SAFETY GUIDELINES - CRITICAL:
- Use ONLY positive, encouraging, and age-appropriate language
- Focus on growth, learning, and development opportunities
- Avoid any negative, harmful, or inappropriate content
- Use simple language that children can understand
- Ensure all activities are safe and suitable for the classroom
- Promote inclusivity and respect for all students

CLASS INFORMATION:
- Class ID: {class_id}
- Number of Students: {num_students}
- Primary Area Needing Intervention: {deficient_area}

CURRENT PERFORMANCE:
EMT Score Averages:
- EMT1 (Visual Emotion Matching): {emt1_avg:.2f}%
- EMT2 (Situation-to-Expression): {emt2_avg:.2f}%
- EMT3 (Expression Labeling): {emt3_avg:.2f}%
- EMT4 (Label-to-Expression): {emt4_avg:.2f}%

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Focus primarily on the deficient area ({deficient_area}) using the strategies provided above
2. Select 3-5 specific activities from the available strategy set
3. Adapt activities to be age-appropriate and engaging for the class
4. Include supporting activities from other EMT areas to maintain overall development
5. Create a 4-week progressive implementation timeline
6. Provide measurable success metrics specific to the deficient area

Your response MUST be a valid JSON object matching this schema EXACTLY:

Here's an example of a valid response structure (adapt content to the current situation):
{example}

IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS:
1. Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text
2. Ensure the JSON structure matches the schema exactly
3. Include at least 3 strategies (maximum 5)
4. Make all strategies specific to the deficient area ({deficient_area})
5. Use the specific strategies provided above for {deficient_area}
6. Include a 4-week timeline with progressive activities
7. Provide measurable success metrics
8. Double-check that your response is valid JSON
9. ENSURE ALL CONTENT IS POSITIVE, SAFE, AND AGE-APPROPRIATE

Focus on creating specific, actionable strategies that address the deficient area while maintaining development in other areas. All content must be suitable for teachers to use with children in educational settings."""
